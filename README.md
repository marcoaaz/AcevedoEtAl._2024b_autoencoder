This repository contains the original scripts to process the micro-analytical data presented in the Figures of the submitted m/s  'Tracking element-mineral associations with unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction in chemical and optical image stacks of thin sections.' to Chemical Geology.

To be able to run the scripts, you require installing:

  +	MATLAB Version: 9.14.0.2239454 (R2023a) Update 1
  +	MATLAB License Number: 729365
  +	Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Version 10.0 (Build 19045)
  +	Java Version: Java 1.8.0_202-b08 with Oracle Corporation Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM mixed mode

, with toolboxes:

  +	Computer Vision Toolbox, Version 10.4
  +	Curve Fitting Toolbox, Version 3.9
  +	Deep Learning Toolbox, Version 14.6
  +	Fixed-Point Designer, Version 7.6
  +	Image Processing Toolbox, Version 11.7
  +	MATLAB Compiler, Version 8.6
  +	Mapping Toolbox, Version 5.5
  +	Parallel Computing Toolbox, Version 7.8
  +	Signal Processing Toolbox, Version 9.2
  +	Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Version 12.5
  + Symbolic Math Toolbox, Version 9.3
  + Wavelet Toolbox, Version 6.3

The script Python version was 3.7.12. The autoencoder script used numpy 1.21.6, scipy 1.7.3, h5py 3.6.0, matplotlib 3.2.2, pytorch 1.12.1, pillow 9.0.1, and tqdm 4.64.1.

## Video explaining the MatLab ROI Tool

The region of interest (ROI) tool is explained in this [video](https://youtu.be/poPmVhwMwbA).

## Future Updates

We expect to increase the support for more file formats from different micro-analytical instruments. Also, file management is done manually and the scripts do not have a Graphical User Interface. 

Feel free to contact if there still are issues after running the code with your own data. Thanks.
